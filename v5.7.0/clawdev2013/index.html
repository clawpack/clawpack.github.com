<h2><font color="#7F0000">Description of the workshop</font></h2>
This informal workshop will be held the week of July 22-26, 2013 at
the University of Washington in Seattle. Some talks will be scheduled Monday
through Thursday mornings that will focus on current and future
developments of the software and open problems. The emphasis will be on
discussion of issues of broad interest and new developments needed to make
the software more powerful and/or easily usable. Afternoons and evenings
will be devoted to informal discussion groups and coding sprints to make
progress in several specific
directions, to be organized in regard to the interests of the
participants. Some general goals for the week include:

<ul>

<li> Testing a number of recent changes to the proposed 
<a href="../doc/index.html">Clawpack 5.0</a> code base, in preparation for an official release.

<li>Discussion of better distribution / installation tools.

<li>Conversion of a number of previous examples from Clawpack 4.x to
the format required for 5.0.

<li>Future development of Riemann solvers with increased flexibility for
Fortran / Python / C applications.

<li>Updating of 3d codes and visualization tools.

<li>Progress on several variants of Clawpack, such as 
<a href="http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa/pyclaw/">PyClaw</a>, 
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/geoclaw">GeoClaw</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ManyClaw/ManyClaw">ManyClaw</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.forestclaw.org">ForestClaw</a>.

<li>Organization of apps / examples and regular regression tests.

<li>Organization of documentation and galleries for multiple projects.

<li>Discussion and/or documentation of coding standards.
</ul>

<h3>Working group work areas</h3>

<ul>
<li> There are some collaboration
tables with large screens on the first floor of Odegaard library (OUGL).  
<p>
<li> Some small rooms and other collaboration spaces are available by
reservation (by UW students or faculty) in OUGL and <a href="http://uw.edu/maps/?suz"> Suzzallo</a> libraries, 
and in the <a href="http://commons.lib.washington.edu/">Research Commons</a> 
area of <a href="http://uw.edu/maps/?alb">Allen Library</a>.
<p>
<li> Several rooms in 
<a href="http://uw.edu/maps/?lew">Lewis Hall</a> (new home of the Applied
Math Department) are available for our use: the conference room 208 and the
rooms 212, 115, and 130.  If they are locked, see Derek in the reception
area on the second floor.  (If anyone wants a desk to work at or a place to
leave things in Lewis, some PhD student desks are available and Derek can
give you a key to an office.)
<p>
Note: Monday it is best to avoid Lewis since movers will be reorganizing
furniture between some of the offices.
<p>
<li> Working groups will tackle some of the topics listed on the 
<a href="https://trello.com/b/q0aj6ugK/clawpack-workshop-2013">Trello
board</a>.
