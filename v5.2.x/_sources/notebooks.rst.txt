IPython notebook examples
=========================

The `IPython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_
is a very nice platform for illustrating Clawpack examples.

If you have used Clawpack with the IPython notebook, please send us a link
or submit a pull request to the `apps repository <http://github.com/clawpack/apps>`_.
The links below will take you to the nbviewer site, where you can view
the notebooks as html.  You can also play animations in them and interact
with some plots, but to actually run the code yourself you should click
the download link at the top-right of each nbviewer page.

You can find demonstrations of how to set up animated results in some of the
notebooks below.  Source for all of these notebooks can also be found
`here <https://github.com/clawpack/apps/tree/master/notebooks>`_.

Examples using PyClaw:

* `A quick introduction to PyClaw <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/8332861>`_
* `A 2D fluid dynamics example <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/8333043>`_
* `Stegotons: solitary waves arising in non-dispersive periodic media <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/ketch/8554686>`_
* More to come 

Examples using the Fortran code:

* `Demo of running the code and producing an animation of results <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8328720>`_
* `Demo of AMRClaw with adjustment of runtime and plotting parameters <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8642159>`_ 
* `Riemann solutions of the shallow water equations <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8994740>`_ 
* More to come
