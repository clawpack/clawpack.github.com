About this software
===================

Clawpack stands for "Conservation Laws Package" and was initially developed
for linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, with a
focus on implementing high-resolution Godunov type methods using limiters in
a general framework applicable to many applications.  These finite volume
methods require a "Riemann solver" to resolve the jump discontinuity at the
interface between two grid cells into waves propagating into the neighboring
cells.  The formulation used in Clawpack allows easy extension to
the solution of hyperbolic problems that are not in conservation form.  

See :ref:`wp_algorithms` for a brief description of the finite volume
methods used in Clawpack and :ref:`riemann` for a description of the
subroutine(s) needed to specify the hyperbolic equation being solved.

Adaptive mesh refinement is included, see :ref:`amrclaw`,  and routines
specialized to depth-averaged geophysical flows can be found in
:ref:`geoclaw`.

The :ref:`pyclaw` software provides a more pythonic interface and
parallelism that scales to tens of thousands of cores.  

New users may wish to read :ref:`clawpack_packages` before starting.

The "wave propagation" algorithms implemented in Clawpack are discribed in
detail in the book *Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems*
[LeVeque-FVMHP]_.
Virtually all of the figures in this book were generated using Clawpack
(version 4.3). 
See :ref:`fvmbook` for a list of available examples with pointers to the codes
and resulting plots.

See the :ref:`biblio` for some pointers to papers describing Clawpack and
the algorithms used in more detail.
