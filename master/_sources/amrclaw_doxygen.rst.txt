Doxygen documentation of AMRClaw
================================

Starting in Version 5.4.1, the Fortran files in AMRClaw have been modified so
that documentation can be generated using `Doxygen
<http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_.

The resulting documentation pages give a description of the parameters and
also show *call graphs* to help understand what other subroutines call a
subroutine or are called by it.  For an example, see
`filpatch.f90 <http://www.clawpack.org/doxygen/amrclaw/2d/filpatch_8f90.html>`_.

See `the file list <http://www.clawpack.org/doxygen/amrclaw/2d/files.html>`_ for
a list of the AMRClaw files.
