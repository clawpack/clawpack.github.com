Pyclaw is a python toolkit containing the basic functionality of Clawpack 
along with various other routines to help users use clawpack.  It has been 
designed with easy extensibility, performance, and exploration in mind.

In order to get the most out of Pyclaw, a brief primer into the structure of
the package is in order.  Pyclaw is broken into two main classes and a set of 
functions that operate with those classes.
