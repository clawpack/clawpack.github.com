Converting README.rst to README.html
-------------------------------------


In Fortran versions of Clawpack-5, the main documentation page 
for an application is often found
in a file named `README.rst`, which can be written using the markup language 
`reStructured Text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.
This is the markup language used by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ for
all of the Clawpack documentation.

The `README.rst` file can be coverted into a `README.html` file by doing::

    python $CLAW/clawutil/src/python/clawutil/convert_readme.py

This is also automatically done by the command::

    make .htmls

which also converts code files into html files for easy browsing.
A list of code files in the directory is automatically generated by
`convert_readme.py` and links inserted in `README.html`.


.. _clawcode2html:

Converting code to html with clawcode2html
-------------------------------------------

The Python script `$CLAW/clawutil/src/python/clawutil/clawcode2html.py` is
invoked by "make .htmls" (in applications directories having Makefiles).

This script does minor syntax highlighting by attempting to put comments in
blue and adds a header at the top.
