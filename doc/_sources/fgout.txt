.. _fgout:

=====================
Fixed grid output
=====================

GeoClaw has the capability to output the results at specified output times
on a specified "fixed grid" by interpolating from the AMR grids active at each 
output time.  This feature is largely unchanged from Clawpack 4.6.  

**Describe further.**

An improved version for monitoring maximum values and arrival times has been
added, see :ref:`fgmax`.
