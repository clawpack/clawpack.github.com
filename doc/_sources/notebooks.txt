IPython notebook examples
=========================

The `IPython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_
is a very nice platform for illustrating Clawpack examples.

Examples using PyClaw:

* `<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/8332861>`_ Introduction to PyClaw
* `<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/8333043>`_ Quadrants example
* More to come 

Examples using the Fortran code:

* `<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8642159>`_ AMR with advecting square
* More to come illustrating AMRClaw and GeoClaw

TODO: Include some tips on using and creating notebooks.
