PyClaw
******

Pyclaw is a Python-based solver for hyperbolic PDEs that includes the algorithms
of Clawpack and SharpClaw.  
It has been designed with easy extensibility, performance, and exploration in mind.
PyClaw is also the basis for PetClaw, a scalable parallel implementation of Clawpack
using PETSc.
At present, PyClaw also includes a python
toolkit containing various other routines to help users use Clawpack.  

You can get the latest development version of PyClaw from
http://github.com/clawpack/pyclaw.

The main PyClaw documentation can be found at http://clawpack.github.com/doc/pyclaw/.
