Developers' Guide

Thanks to `gitwash <https://github.com/matthew-brett/gitwash>`_ there
is a good description at the first link below.  These pages were created
automatically by executing `make_gitwash.sh
<https://github.com/clawpack/doc/blob/master/doc/make_gitwash.sh>`_
and requires only the file
`gitwash_dumper.py
<https://github.com/matthew-brett/gitwash/blob/master/gitwash_dumper.py>`_.

The second link was created
before discovering gitwash but may still be useful...
