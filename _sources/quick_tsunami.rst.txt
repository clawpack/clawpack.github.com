As always, the best way to get started is to copy a working example and
modify it to do what you want.  For example, you might start with
`$CLAW/geoclaw/examples/tsunami/chile2010`.

If you clone the :ref:`apps` then there are two Jupyter notebooks that
illustrate how to make some simple changes to the setup for this example,
and lead you through some exercises:

 - `$CLAW/apps/notebooks/geoclaw/chile2010a/chile2010a.ipynb`
 - `$CLAW/apps/notebooks/geoclaw/chile2010b/chile2010b.ipynb`

To work with :ref:`topo` data and :ref:`okada`, see also the
tutorials

 - `$CLAW/apps/notebooks/geoclaw/topotools_examples.ipynb`
 - `$CLAW/apps/notebooks/geoclaw/dtopotools_examples.ipynb`
 - `$CLAW/apps/notebooks/geoclaw/Okada.ipynb`

These are also visible online, see :ref:`notebooks`.
