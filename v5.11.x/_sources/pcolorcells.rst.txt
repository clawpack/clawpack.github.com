pcolorcells
==============================

The visclaw function `clawpack.visclaw.plottools.pcolorcells` invokes the
matplotlib `pcolormesh` function but is designed to be used more easily with
the cell-centered data computed in Clawpack on different grid resolutions,
with AMR patches generally aligned on cell edges.

See the docstring for more information, :ref:`plottools_module`.
