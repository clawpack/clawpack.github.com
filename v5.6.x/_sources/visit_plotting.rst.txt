Plotting with VisIt
===================

2d and 3d plots can be rendered using the visualization package
`VisIt <https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/home.html>`_.  
VisIt has a Claw reader that can be used to
import data from Clawpack, see `Application Toolkit Formats
<http://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=Detailed_list_of_file_formats_VisIt_supports#Application_Toolkit_Formats>`_
for other formats that VisIt supports.

The ASCII output files generated by Clawpack can be read in
directly to VisIt if one additional file is added to the directory
of output files:  a file named `plot.claw` is required with contents::

    DIR=.
    TIME_FILES_SCANF=fort.t%04d
    GRID_FILES_SCANF=fort.q%04d

When using the VisIt GUI, simply open this file to load the data.
See the `VisIt documentation <https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/doc.html>`_
for information on how to use the GUI.


**To do:**

 * Create Python tools using the Python interface to VisIt so that plots
   can be specified in `setplot.py`.

 * Add routines to Clawpack to output data in Silo format, the binary
   format recommended for VisIt, and/or other binary formats.
