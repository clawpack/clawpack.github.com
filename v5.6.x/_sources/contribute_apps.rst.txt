Contributing examples and applications
======================================

The :ref:`apps` contains a few examples of applications that can be solved
using Clawpack.  We hope to greatly expand this repository in the future.

Contributions from users are desired.  We are still working out the best way
to collect applications.  One possibility is to use git submodules.
For now you can issue a pull request to 
`https://github.com/clawpack/apps <https://github.com/clawpack/apps>`_.

Stay tuned for more details....

Of course you can always post your results using the techniques described in
:ref:`sharing`.
