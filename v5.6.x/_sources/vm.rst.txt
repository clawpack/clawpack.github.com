Clawpack Virtual Machine 
=============================================================

See also :ref:`docker_image`, which is now the suggested way to use a virtual
machine.

There is no Clawpack 5.0 VM yet.

See `The Clawpack 4.6 VM documentation
<http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/users-4.x/vm.html>`_ for now.
This VM should work with Clawpack 5.0 if you install it following the
:ref:`installing`.
