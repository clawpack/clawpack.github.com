Elasticity equations in a region consisting of two materials with a corner
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    
Example [book/chap22/corner] to accompany the book 
`Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems
<http://www.clawpack.org/book.html>`_
by R. J. LeVeque.

Converted to Clawpack 5.0 form in 2014.


**Note:**

 - `mx=400, my=400` was used for the plots in the book.
 - The elastic parameters are defined in `setprob.data`
 - and the inclusion geometry is specified by `fdisc.f`
 - Elastic parameters in each cell are set in `setaux.f`
 - The wave is generated by specifying a right-going P-wave in `qinit.f`
