Jupyter notebook examples
=========================

The `Jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_
(formerly known as IPython notebook)
is a very nice platform for illustrating Clawpack examples.

If you have used Clawpack with the Jupyter notebook, please send us a link
or submit a pull request to the `apps repository <http://github.com/clawpack/apps>`_.
The links below will take you to static view of several notebooks
as html files.  You can also play animations in them and interact
with some plots, but to actually run the code yourself you should clone the 
apps repository.

**Warning:** The notebooks and tools to support them are being actively
developed, so these may change in the near future and the versions posted
here may not work with the current Clawpack.
