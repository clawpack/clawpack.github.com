Installing Clawpack
**************************************

See also:

- :ref:`releases`
- :ref:`docker_image` as an alternative to installing

**Register:** Please `register <http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/register/index.html>`_
if you have not already done so.  This is very useful in helping
us track the extent of usage, and important to the :ref:`funding` agencies
who support this work.

**Prerequisites:** Before installing, check that you have the :ref:`prereqs`.
   
**Please see** 

- :ref:`clawpack_packages` 

before installing, particularly if you are not sure whether you will
be using the Fortran versions of the PDE solvers 
(:ref:`contents_fortcodes`) or the :ref:`pyclaw` version of the PDE solvers.

**Then choose the best installation option** for your needs from this list:

- If you **only** plan to use PyClaw to solve the PDEs and Visclaw for plotting,
  we suggest 
  
  - :ref:`install_quick_pyclaw`.
  
- If you **only** plan to use the Fortran variants of Clawpack
  (:ref:`contents_fortcodes`) for solving the PDEs, together with
  Visclaw for plotting and other Python tools (e.g. from geoclaw or clawutil),
  then we suggest 
  
  - :ref:`installing_fortcodes`.
  
- If you are a power user who plans to use both PyClaw and the Fortran variants
  for solving PDEs, we recommend 
  
  - :ref:`install_quick_all`.
